    "\n",
    "* Iterators are immutable objects which contain a sequence of values or collections and can be used to iterate over them. These sequences can be a list, or a string, or a tuple, etc,. The iterator only stores the first element of the sequence in memory. To iterate over the sequence, we can use the next() method. The next method will return the next element of the sequence and will return an exception if there is no next element.\n",
    "\n",
    "* On the other hand, generators are functions which are used to create iterators. In a generator function, we simply use the yield statement instead of the return statement, so the function acts like an iterator."

    "* When you are creating a function that should return a sequence of values, a normal python function will only return the first value of the sequence.\n",
    "* To counter this, we can make use of the yield statement instead of the return statement. The yield statement will return the execution to the caller, but it will also retain the state of the iteratable in memory, so the function can be called multiple times using the next() function to iterate through the sequence."
